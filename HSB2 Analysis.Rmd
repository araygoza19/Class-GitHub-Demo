```{r, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

hsb2 <- read_csv("hsb2.csv")

hsb2$ses <- factor(hsb2$ses, level = 1:3, labels = c("low", "middle", "high"))

```

## Relationship of SES to Math Scores 

This section will look at the realtionship of socioeconomic status to math scores. I will begin with summary of math scores

```{r}
hsb2 %>%
  group_by(ses) %>%
  summarize(mean(math), median(math), sd(math), min(math), max(math))
```


Now lets look at the plot.
```{r}
hsb2%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ses, y = math)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
